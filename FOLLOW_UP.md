# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

I used Vitejs, which is faster than create-react-app
I used tailwind and react

### Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?

Graphql, express and node-fetch

### Q) Any other comments we should read before evaluating your solution?

I used a plugin to bypass CORs, it was faster than creating a proxy

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would create a proxy for the cors issue, and handle that with my own backend.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

The speed I solved the first question in.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Backend, type errors and trial and error with deprecated packages.
I have gotten used to backend with Graphql and amplify, which helps avoid a lot of packages.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

Enjoyed the test overally.
